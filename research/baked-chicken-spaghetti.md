## Own cooking judgment
- Raw chicken breast poached to 74 °C instead of pre-cooked chicken.
- Tinned tomatoes plus a fresh green chilli instead of tomatoes with chiles.

## Reliability checks
- Safe temperatures checked against USDA FSIS (ground meat 71 °C, poultry 74 °C, leftovers reheated to 74 °C).
- Doneness cues in the method: 2 step(s) carry a temperature, and every cooking step has a visual cue.
- Timing sanity check: prep 25 min + cook 70 min against the step times.
- Quantities checked against servings (6). Nutrition worked from USDA FDC (see content/notes/baked-chicken-spaghetti-nutrition.md).
- Locked-list sources supporting the core method (excluding FSIS/FDC): 1. Non-top-tier pages are context only.

Items checked: CHECKLIST sections 1-7; 06-G1 (salt by weight); 06-G3 (flavour sequence); 06-G9 (safe temperatures, storage); 02-C1 (74 °C, carryover; resting is not juice reabsorption); 04-P1 (water salt %); 04-P2 (water volume, no oil); 04-P3 (al dente, finish in sauce, reserve 240 ml); 04-P4 (emulsion); CHECKLIST 6 (preheat at least 20 min, stated before the oven step).
Changes made:
- Salt given in grams (06-G1): 0.5 tsp fine salt -> 3 g
- Units: °C only, metric weights and volumes (CHECKLIST 7, updated 22 Oct to metric only).
