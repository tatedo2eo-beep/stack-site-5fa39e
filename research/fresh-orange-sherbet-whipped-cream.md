## Own cooking judgment
- Orange liqueur or spirit in the source omitted.

## Reliability checks
- Safe temperatures checked against USDA FSIS (ground meat 71 °C, poultry 74 °C, leftovers reheated to 74 °C).
- Doneness cues in the method: 1 step(s) carry a temperature, and every cooking step has a visual cue.
- Timing sanity check: prep 20 min + cook 0 min against the step times.
- Quantities checked against servings (6). Nutrition worked from USDA FDC (see content/notes/fresh-orange-sherbet-whipped-cream-nutrition.md).
- Locked-list sources supporting the core method (excluding FSIS/FDC): 1. Non-top-tier pages are context only.
