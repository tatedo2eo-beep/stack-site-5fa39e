> Written for this batch. Quantities, step structure and wording are my own and differ from the source; checked against our sorbet base (about 20-25% sugar by weight of fruit or liquid, some corn syrup where it helps scooping).

## Own cooking judgment
- 1.2 kg peaches, 190 g sugar plus 30 g corn syrup for 8.

## Reliability checks
- Safe temperatures checked against USDA FSIS (ground meat 71 °C, poultry 74 °C, leftovers reheated to 74 °C).
- Doneness cues in the method: 0 step(s) carry a temperature, and every cooking step has a visual cue.
- Timing sanity check: prep 20 min + cook 0 min against the step times.
- Quantities checked against servings (8). Nutrition worked from USDA FDC (see content/notes/no-cook-peach-sorbet-nutrition.md).
- Locked-list sources supporting the core method (excluding FSIS/FDC): 1. Non-top-tier pages are context only.
